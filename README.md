# CodeChallenge

1) Before Running Application, DownLoad the whole file, Use Visual Studio 2022(I use it to design the elevator, it works on my laptop, if you have other tools, you can try) to open the CodeChallenge.slh

2) Run Application, Go to Program.cs file, Run the CodeChallenge solution


Reminder: The application will log elevator_log.txt in the file (..\CodeChallenge\CodeChallenge\bin\Debug\net6.0)
